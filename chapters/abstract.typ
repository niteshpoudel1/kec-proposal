In modern industrial and residential environments, automation plays a vital role in improving efficiency, reducing human intervention, and conserving resources. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are widely used in automation systems due to their reliability, modularity, and real-time control capabilities. However, traditional PLCs are often costly and lack flexibility for prototyping, education, or small-scale use.

This project presents the design and implementation of a low-cost, programmable logic controller using the ESP32 microcontroller and the OpenPLC platform. The system is programmed using Ladder Logic, adhering to the IEC 61131-3 standard, to replicate industrial PLC behavior. As a real-world application, an Automatic Water Tank Filling System is developed to demonstrate the functionality of the ESP32-based PLC. The system uses level sensors to monitor water levels and relay-based output control to operate a water pump, ensuring automatic filling while preventing overflow.

The proposed system is modular, expandable, and cost-effective, making it ideal for academic projects, prototype development, and small industrial automation tasks. By combining open-source software and affordable hardware, this project demonstrates a practical and scalable alternative to conventional PLCs.
