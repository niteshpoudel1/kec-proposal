Greenhouse cultivation requires precise monitoring and control of environmental parameters to ensure optimal plant growth and resource efficiency. This project presents the design and implementation of a greenhouse monitoring and controlling system that continuously measures key environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity using a network of sensors. The collected data is processed by a microcontroller-based control unit, which automatically regulates actuators including irrigation systems, ventilation fans, heaters, and artificial lighting to maintain optimal growing conditions. The system supports real-time monitoring and decision-making, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing water and energy consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system effectively maintains stable environmental conditions, improves crop productivity, and provides a cost-effective and scalable solution suitable for small- and large-scale greenhouse applications.
